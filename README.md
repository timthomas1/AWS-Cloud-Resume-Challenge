This is my repository for the AWS Cloud Resume Challenge.

The Cloud Resume Challenge, created by Forrest Brazeal, is designed to give aspiring cloud engineers a practical way to showcase their skills by building a serverless resume website using AWS (Amazon Web Services) technologies. 

I chose to start the Cloud Resume Challenge to build a useful project that demonstrates hands-on experience with the AWS platform and its services. The structured nature of the Cloud Resume Challenge appealed to me because it offered a general roadmap to follow while allowing ample room for creativity, exploration, and trial-and-error.
